# Biased_Sort
The code is a java implementation of a very famous sorting algorithm but, the code has a bug, think of this as a challenge, you have to do the following tasks

1)Find out for kind of inputs the code works without raising an exception.
2)Fix the bug in the best possible way.

Hint : A program is a sequence of instructions and the order of the instructions matter, put the instructions in the right order.

Note : It would be better if you could track the bug by just visualizing the code (without compiling and running), but, if you HAVE to compile it, go ahead.
